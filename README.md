# Daily AIML Challenge - Day [1]: Python Fundamentals

This repository contains the Python code solution for Day [1] of the #60DaysOfAIML challenge. This day focused on reinforcing fundamental Python programming concepts, which are crucial building blocks for more advanced AI and ML topics.

## Challenge Overview

The challenge for Day [1] involved a series of small programming tasks designed to test and improve proficiency in basic Python syntax and common programming patterns. Each part built upon foundational knowledge, preparing for more complex assignments.

## Concepts Covered

This project demonstrates the practical application of the following Python concepts:

* **Part 1: Input & Output**
    * Getting user input (`input()`)
    * Printing formatted output (`print()`, f-strings)
    * Type conversion (`float()`, `int()`)
    * Basic arithmetic operations (addition)

* **Part 2: If-Else Conditions**
    * Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
    * Comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `==`)

* **Part 3: Loops**
    * `for` loops for iteration
    * `range()` function for generating sequences of numbers
    * Printing sequences and filtering (e.g., even numbers)

* **Part 4: Strings**
    * String manipulation
    * Calculating string length (`len()`)
    * Reversing a string manually (without slicing `[::-1]`)

* **Part 5: Lists**
    * Creating and initializing lists
    * Accessing list elements (by index)
    * Modifying lists (`.append()`)

## Code Structure

The entire solution is contained within a single Python file, `daily_aiml_day_X.py` (or `daily_aiml_day_X.ipynb` if you used Jupyter Notebook). The code is organized into sections corresponding to each part of the challenge, with comments to explain different segments.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the file:**
    If it's a `.py` file:
    ```bash
    cd [path/to/your/file]
    ```
3.  **Execute the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python daily_aiml_day_1.py
    ```
    If you are using a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`), open it with Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.

The script will prompt you for input as it progresses through the different tasks.
